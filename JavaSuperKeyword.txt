				|==>SUPER Keyword<==|
				+-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-+

Another keyword important for constructors is the super keyword, which references the "super", or parent class.

When invoked as a method super(), the parent class constructor will be called. A super() call or a this() call MUST be the first line of any constructor.

If the super() call is not explicitly provided; the compiler will inject it on the first line.

Also, like the this keyword, it can be used in multiple areas in our code. So let us go over those.

1) super() can be used to invoke the immediate parent class 	constructor
2) super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class so that 	we can invoke one of the parent class's methods.
3)super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class so that we 	can access one of the parent class's instance variables.
